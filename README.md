This application is designed to handle CSV files by receiving the file, processing its contents, and comparing the records against an existing database. It efficiently checks each record and identifies any entries that do not exist in the database. The application then returns only those records that are missing, allowing users to quickly identify and manage non-existing data entries within their system
